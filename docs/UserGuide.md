# SGSafe User Guide

SGSafe is a *Command Line Interface (CLI) based case management system* that is designed specifically for law
enforcement agencies in Singapore to manage, track and process cases. Built with the diverse needs of police personnel
in mind, this application allows frontline officers to efficiently manage and process cases from creation to closure. By
providing an easy to use yet efficient interface, SGSafe transforms traditional case management processes into an
organised digital workflow that enhances operational efficiency for the public sector.

## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.\
    >   e.g., in `add --title TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add --title Murder at Yishun`.
>
> * Parameters with command line flags can be in any order.\
    >   e.g., if the command specifies `--title TITLE --date DATE`, `--date DATE --title TITLE` is also acceptable.
>
> * Parameters that are not preceded by command line flags must appear in the order specified.\
    >   e.g., if the command specifies `close INDEX` INDEX must come after close.
>
> * Optional parameters are enclosed in square brackets.\
    >   e.g., `--title TITLE [--victim VICTIM]` means the victim parameter is optional.
> * The double-dash `--` is a reserved prefix used to identify flags, so it cannot be used as part of an input value.
> * You cannot use the character | in your input as well as it is used in the save file format.
