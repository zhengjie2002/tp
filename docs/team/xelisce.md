### Project: SGSafe

SGSafe is a command-line application designed to help investigative teams manage case files efficiently. It supports structured data entry, filtering, and verbose summaries for legal and operational clarity. The system is written in Java and organized into modular packages for maintainability and scalability.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Project Management**:
    * Created and managed all GitHub milestones (`v1.0`, `v2.0`, `v2.1`), including deadlines and scope definitions.
    * Coordinated milestone goals with team members to ensure timely delivery and feature alignment.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `ListCommand`
    * What it does: Lists cases in either summary or verbose format, with optional filtering by status and category.
    * Justification: This feature is central to the application's usability, allowing users to view case data clearly and flexibly.
    * Highlights:
        * Implemented `ListCommand` in `v1.0`.
        * Added `--mode` flag in `v2.0` to toggle between `verbose` and `summary` views.
        * Added `--status` flag in `v2.0` to filter cases by `open`, `closed`, or `all`.
        * Enhanced summary mode with a header line showing `ID`, `TITLE`, etc.
        * Added a dynamic info sentence indicating how many cases are listed and their status.
        * Refined verbose mode formatting for readability and alignment.
        * Integrated category display and ensured soft-deleted cases are excluded from listings.
        * Maintained and updated `ListCommandTest` to reflect evolving logic and formatting changes. 
        * Converted internal numeric case IDs to 6-character hexadecimal strings for consistent display formatting.

* **Foundational Contributions**:
    * Laid the foundation for the `Case` and `CaseManager` classes.
    * Built the initial `Display` and `Parser` classes, including the embedded `Validator`.
    * Created the base `Command` class and defined the full action workflow: parsing → dispatch → execution.
    * Refactored all references from Duke to SGSafe, establishing project identity.
    * Organized the codebase into logical packages: `utils/command`, `utils/ui`, `domain/casefiles`.

* **Testing Contributions**:
    * Set up the first actual and expected UI test text files for system-level testing.
    * Created JUnit tests for `Parser` to validate command parsing and error handling (team-wide coverage).
    * Added targeted parser tests for `ListCommand`, covering flag combinations and edge cases.
    * Authored and maintained `ListCommandTest`, testing summary vs verbose output, status filtering, category inclusion, and truncation behavior.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2526s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=xelisce&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2025-09-19T00%3A00%3A00&filteredFileName=&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=xelisce&tabRepo=AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Documentation**:
    * **User Guide**:
        * Added documentation for the `list` command, including `--mode` and `--status` flags.
        * Provided examples for both verbose and summary modes.
        * Clarified expected output structure and optional field behavior.
    * **Developer Guide**:
        * Documented implementation details of `ListCommand`.
        * Explained formatting logic, conditional field inclusion, and category integration.
        * Described rationale for soft-deletion filtering and test coverage strategy.

* **Community**:
    * Reviewed PRs (with non-trivial review comments). Examples: [#18](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/18), [#27](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/27), [#37](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/37)
    * Replied to feedback on my own PRs and incorporated suggestions from teammates. [#8](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/8), [#9](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/9), [#11](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/pull/11)
    * Identified bugs: [Example Bug Report](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-W13-3/tp/issues/72)
    * Provided feedback on teammates' command structure, formatting logic, and test clarity.
